A simple cardboard spool designed for 100G filament samples in 1.75mm diameter. It's assembled from 10 pieces of cardboard and held together with printed pins. The inspiration for this concept was subscriptions to filament boxes, and not having the time or desire to print dozens of sample spools. This is an environmentally friendly option that is mostly recyclable.

Six sets of filament cutouts are available for start and ends of the filament coil, and the sides are removable for easy loading. Filament can also be secured in the exposed corrugated cardboard. The pins are oversized to be pressure fit in the cardboard and are a tight fit that holds together snug.

### Dimensions (100G)
Designed for 4mm thick cardboard.

- Cores 50mm ID 105mm OD (8x)
- Sides 150mm OD (2x)
- Pins 40mm x 6.7mm x 4.7mm (x3)
